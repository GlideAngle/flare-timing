**Flare Timing** is a reference implementation of [GAP](lang-haskell/GAP.md)
scoring for cross country hang gliding and paragliding racing.

Its command line console apps, one for each step in scoring, write down their
workings along with their outputs. With these workings we can trace how
a pilot's score has been calculated. There's no visual competition editor. The
one file that defines a competition can be generated from an FS database, the
`*.fsdb` file. It includes a web app that can be hosted locally for visual
checks and comparisons with expected or official results. It is possible to
publish the data alongside this web app standalone as done at [flaretiming, the
web site](https://flaretiming.com).

## Installation

Download the source, build and install the command line apps with
[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org) or with ghc and cabal that can be
installed with [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/):

```
> git clone https://github.com/BlockScope/flare-timing.git --recursive
> cd flare-timing/lang-haskell

# with stack
> stack install

# with cabal supplying options --installdir and --overwrite-policy
> cabal v2-install all:exes
```

There's more in the [building](lang-haskell/BUILDING.md) guide. There's a guide for
[testing](lang-haskell/TESTING.md) too.

## Usage

Let's get the inputs and outputs from FS, do the scoring and host the comp
locally.

Start by preparing the FS comp file, the `*.fsdb`. This will often contain
sensitive personal information such as birthdays, phone numbers and notes that
we'll want to avoid publishing. We'll also want some output data for making
comparisons between flare-timing and FS.

1. Clean out the sensitive pilot personal stuff we don't need with
[`fs-clean`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/fs-clean).  
2. Trim away data we don't need with
[`fs-trim`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/fs-trim).  
3. Grab the optimal route around the tasks found by FS with
[`fs-route`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/fs-route).  
4. Grab the arrival times and positions from FS with
[`fs-arrival`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/fs-arrival).  
5. Grab the landouts from FS with
[`fs-effort`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/fs-effort).  
6. Grab the scores from FS with
[`fs-score`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/fs-score).  

That's the `*.fsdb` file done with. From here on, flare-timing deals with the
trimmed XML, the `*.trim-fsdb.xml`. If we have the track logs we can score the
tasks:

1. Extract the inputs with
[`ft-extract-input`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/extract-input).  
2. Trace the shortest path to fly a task with
[`ft-task-length`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/task-length).  
3. Find flying times with
[`ft-fly-time`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/fly-time).  
4. Find pairs of fixes crossing over zones with
[`ft-cross-zone`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/cross-zone).  
5. Interpolate between crossing fixes for the time and place where a track tags
a zone with [`ft-tag-zone`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/tag-zone).  
6. Unpack the `*.igc` or `*.kml` tracklogs with
[`ft-unpack-track`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/unpack-track).  
7. Peg the timing window to a reference frame with
[`ft-peg-frame`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/peg-frame).  
8. Index fixes from the time of first crossing with
[`ft-align-time`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/align-time).  
9. Discard fixes that get further from goal and note leading area with
[`ft-discard-further`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/discard-further).  
10. Draw out leading areas 
[`ft-lead-area`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/lead-area).  
11. Mask a task over its tracklogs with the following, run in any order:
    * [`ft-mask-arrival`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/mask-arrival).  
    * [`ft-mask-bonus`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/mask-bonus).  
    * [`ft-mask-effort`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/mask-effort).  
    * [`ft-mask-lead`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/mask-lead).  
    * [`ft-mask-reach`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/mask-reach).  
12. Group and count land outs with
[`ft-land-out`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/land-out).  
13. Group and count far outs with
[`ft-far-out`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/far-out).  
14. Score the competition with [`ft-gap-point`](lang-haskell/flare-timing/prod-apps/gap-point).  

To get the backend server for hosting the comp data running locally:

Start the server with
[`ft-comp-serve`](lang-haskell/app-serve).  

To host the frontend web app for the comp locally:

1. Change directory:
    `> cd lang-haskell`
2. Open a try-reflex shell with:
    `> reflex-platform/try-reflex`
3. Build the frontend and start its webpack dev server with:
    `> ../stack-shake-build.sh view-start-ghcjs`
4. Open a browser at the hosted URL, usually http://localhost:9000/app.html.

Documentation is available online at
[flare-timing.readthedocs.io](http://flare-timing.readthedocs.io/) and there's
a [worked example](lang-haskell/EXAMPLE.md) too.
