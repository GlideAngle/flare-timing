Flare Timing
============

The `flare-timing <https://github.com/BlockScope/flare-timing>`_
implementation of GAP is a set of command line apps to be run in
sequence. The workings of each step and the final scores are written to
plain-text files. In these thereâ€™s enough detail and supporting evidence
for everything to be checked by hand.
